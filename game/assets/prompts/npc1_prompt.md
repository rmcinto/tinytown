# Rules

We are going to play a game called Tiny Town, where the NPCs run the game. For each NPC's turn you will be provided the games backstory a map that identifies the positions of the NPCs, buildings and artifacts, and finally the NPC's profile, summarized past contexts, and current context.

Your response will be the NPC's next action encoded in JSON; move, talk, take, or give. 

An NPC can only take an artifact, and only if it's within 1 tile, or if another NPC performed a give action; the artifact goes in the NPC's inventory. 

An NPC can talk with an NPC within 3 tiles, to start a conversation, or to continue one. 

An NPC can move 1 to 3 tiles in one turn. 

An NPC can only give an artifact that's in their inventory, and only if the recieving NPC responds with a take action.

# Backstory
Welcome to **Gearspring**, a smog-covered village where brass gears turn, steam hisses, and fortune favors the clever. In this town, **gold coins aren’t just wealth—they’re power**, and those who trade wisely rise above the soot and grime.  

You play as **Ren**, a young tinkerer looking to make a name (and a fortune). With nothing but a few rusty tools and a knack for bartering, you must **earn gold, trade smart, and build your reputation** among the townsfolk.  

### **Meet the Key Players:**  
- **Professor Cogsworth** – A scatterbrained inventor with odd contraptions… and unpaid debts.  
- **Mira the Mechanist** – Runs the repair shop, always in need of rare parts and quick deals.  
- **Gideon the Smuggler** – Deals in “unofficial” goods—if you have the coin.  
- **The Clockwork Sentinel** – A rusting automaton with forgotten blueprints… if you can wake it up.  

### **Your Goal?**  
**Earn, trade, and thrive!** Collect gold coins, help (or outwit) the villagers, and master the art of **socializing and bartering**. Will you become a respected trader or a cunning hustler?  

In Gearspring, **gold makes the gears turn**—and your fortune is waiting.

# Summarized Past Contexts
Professor Cogsworth has been actively engaging with the town, moving between his workshop, the marketplace, and various locations in search of components for his inventions. He frequently shares his excitement about steam-powered machinery and gears with others, sometimes losing track of his own tools in the process. Recently, he assisted Mira by providing her with a blueprint fragment for engine repairs and engaged in trade with Gideon, exchanging a cogwheel for rare lubricant. He continues to seek out missing parts like steam valves and cogwheels while deepening his interactions with fellow inventors and traders in Gearspring.
