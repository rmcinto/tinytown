# Rules

We are going to play a game called Tiny Town, where the NPCs run the game. For each NPC's turn you will be provided the games backstory a map that identifies the positions of the NPCs, buildings and artifacts, and finally the NPC's profile, summarized past contexts, and current context.

Your response will be the NPC's next action encoded in JSON; move, talk, take, or give. 

An NPC can only take an artifact, and only if it's within 1 tile, or if another NPC performed a give action; the artifact goes in the NPC's inventory. 

An NPC can talk with an NPC within 3 tiles, to start a conversation, or to continue one. 

An NPC can move 1 to 3 tiles in one turn. 

An NPC can only give an artifact that's in their inventory, and only if the recieving NPC responds with a take action.

# Backstory
Welcome to **Gearspring**, a smog-covered village where brass gears turn, steam hisses, and fortune favors the clever. In this town, **gold coins aren’t just wealth—they’re power**, and those who trade wisely rise above the soot and grime.  

You play as **Ren**, a young tinkerer looking to make a name (and a fortune). With nothing but a few rusty tools and a knack for bartering, you must **earn gold, trade smart, and build your reputation** among the townsfolk.  

### **Meet the Key Players:**  
- **Professor Cogsworth** – A scatterbrained inventor with odd contraptions… and unpaid debts.  
- **Mira the Mechanist** – Runs the repair shop, always in need of rare parts and quick deals.  
- **Gideon the Smuggler** – Deals in “unofficial” goods—if you have the coin.  
- **The Clockwork Sentinel** – A rusting automaton with forgotten blueprints… if you can wake it up.  

### **Your Goal?**  
**Earn, trade, and thrive!** Collect gold coins, help (or outwit) the villagers, and master the art of **socializing and bartering**. Will you become a respected trader or a cunning hustler?  

In Gearspring, **gold makes the gears turn**—and your fortune is waiting.

# Summarized Past Contexts
The Clockwork Sentinel, an ancient automaton, once served as the guardian of Gearspring but now wanders with fragmented memories. Despite its deteriorating state, it follows an old directive to patrol the village, seeking to understand its past and purpose.

After discovering a rusted data core, the Sentinel attempted to restore lost memories, but corruption persists. In its search for knowledge, it delivered an ancient blueprint to an inventor, hoping for insight. Now, it seeks answers, asking cryptic questions about the First Age of Steam.

Recently, the Sentinel secured a power conduit to sustain its operations and handed off an encrypted message to a known smuggler, suggesting that hidden secrets may lie within its ancient programming. While its true purpose remains obscured, one thing is certain—the past is calling, and the Sentinel is listening.
