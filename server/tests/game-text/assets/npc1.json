        "Professor Cogsworth has been actively engaging with the town, moving between his workshop, the marketplace, and various locations in search of components for his inventions.",
        "He frequently shares his excitement about steam-powered machinery and gears with others, sometimes losing track of his own tools in the process.",
        "Recently, he assisted Mira by providing her with a blueprint fragment for engine repairs and engaged in trade with Gideon, exchanging a cogwheel for rare lubricant.",
        "He continues to seek out missing parts like steam valves and cogwheels while deepening his interactions with fellow inventors and traders in Gearspring."
